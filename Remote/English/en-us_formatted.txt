RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: Our investigation has lead us to Kyurem, a Dragon- and Ice-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: The freezing energy Kyurem generates inside itself is so powerful that when it leaked out, it froze Kyurem's body solid.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: So let's do some warm-ups, %PLAYERNAME%! We want to stay limber for the big day of exploring ahead of us.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: There are rumors that Kyurem may dwell in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: Unova is an extraordinary place. It has bustling, modern metropolises, but it's also home to tranquil forests where people live in harmony with nature.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: And to confront a mystery discovered in Unova, it's only fitting we get help from Pokémon discovered in Unova too.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which of these first partner Pokémon would you choose for this adventure?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_00
TEXT: The shell on Oshawott's body is called its "scalchop."

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_01
TEXT: Oshawott uses its scalchop not only as a blade in battle but also as a tool to break open hard Berries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_02
TEXT: It sharpens it on riverbed stones, just like a human with a whetstone.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_03
TEXT: A perfect-sized shell and stone are just some of Oshawott's unique needs.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_04
TEXT: I bet Kyurem has unique needs too... While you train your new partner, I'll study Kyurem to find out what it wants.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_00
TEXT: Snivy avoids groups, so it's a great match for Trainers who are more independent.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_01
TEXT: It uses its tail to photosynthesize sunlight. If Snivy's not feeling well, its tail will start to droop.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_02
TEXT: On the other hand — or vine! — Snivy who are full of energy become swift and dexterous.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_01
TEXT: Tepig loves to roast its food, but sometimes it gets too excited and burns its meal to a crisp.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_02
TEXT: It shoots fireballs from its nose, but if it's feeling ill, that fire turns to pitch-black smoke.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_03
TEXT: Snacks aplenty is just one of Tepig's unique needs.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_04
TEXT: I bet Kyurem has unique needs too... While you train your new partner, I'll study Kyurem to find out what it wants.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Kyurem seems to be looking for something...

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: According to my research, it's waiting for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with either truth or ideals.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: I wonder what that means? While you're certainly my hero, %PLAYERNAME%, we don't fully understand the mystery of truth and ideals.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: The best we can do for now is slow Kyurem down. Battle Kyurem with all your different strengths, and you're sure to succeed!x

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00

TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Funny you should pop by—I was just reflecting on our incredible journey together!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: Encountering gigantic Pokémon, unfurling incredible mysteries, foiling Team GO Rocket countless times... We’ve faced extraordinary challenges together, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Our research has introduced us to Pokémon from all over the world, forged wonderful friendships, and led to some amazing discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: And speaking of discoveries, I’ve noticed some unusual sounds lately.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_04
TEXT: I’m going to investigate, and while I do, I need you to continue your excellent work in the field.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: Good news, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve made a breakthrough on those acoustic mysteries I was looking into.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: And as I suspected, they’re not just any sound wave, they’re the unique melodies of the Mythical Pokémon Meloetta!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: Meloetta uses song to influence the emotions of those who hear it. And on that note, I’d like you to try and spot any unusual behavior in the local Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: It’s not every day we get to study a Mythical Pokémon, so let’s make the most of this opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_00
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! We may not have found Meloetta yet, but I can definitely still hear it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01
TEXT: So our musical friend can’t be too far off—we just might have to change our usual pitch.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and do a little singing and dancing to see if it affects people and Pokémon nearby?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_03
TEXT: Who knows, that might be the "key" to success! Heh heh... Music joke. I’ve got a million!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: If it isn’t our intrepid enter-Trainer! Say, did you know that Meloetta’s melodies have inspired many famous songs?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: It’s just fascinating—Meloetta shows us how music helps us to forge special bonds with one another.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: It’s not unlike your amazing ability to connect with other people and Pokémon. Every new Pokémon you catch or Trainer you meet is a new potential friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: And on that uplifting note, get out there and see what new friendships await, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve dug up some useful information on Meloetta. Did you know that it was first discovered in the Unova region?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01
TEXT: That might not seem critical, but we have to take advantage of every scrap of information we can to help us make sense of Meloetta’s behavior.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_02
TEXT: Keep up your fieldwork, if you would! Watch for Pokémon experiencing strong emotions, check out some new places, and maybe try to forge some new connections.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_03
TEXT: Let’s keep this research rhythm going!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_00
TEXT: This is the moment we’ve been waiting for, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_01
TEXT: Your dedicated work has helped me to pinpoint Meloetta’s location at last!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_02
TEXT: This could be your chance to befriend an extraordinary Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_05_03
TEXT: Head out there and show Meloetta the same kindness and dedication you’ve shown all your Pokémon friends!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_00
TEXT: I knew you’d “measure” up, %PLAYERNAME%! And—whoa!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_01
TEXT: What a striking appearance this Meloetta has! My research notes have nothing about this distinctive coloring. It’s truly incredible!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_02
TEXT: I’ve been watching your journey since you took your first steps as a Trainer. Seeing how far you’ve come makes me so proud to call you my research partner—and more importantly, my friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_06_03

TEXT: The duality that we have witnessed has revealed the sharp contrasts in this world’s nature—and its people.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_2
TEXT: I am particularly intrigued by the latest instance we encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_3
TEXT: Both Blanche and Cliff sought innovation in battling, yet one took a defensive stance, and the other turned to the pursuit of power alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_4
TEXT: I would like to examine this further. If you will excuse me, I must review these findings with Professor Willow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_1
TEXT: You are more experienced than I with battles, %PLAYERNAME%, so please provide your insight. Would you agree that a balanced approach is important for a Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_2
TEXT: Intriguing. Perhaps that is the key, then, to understanding these recent events.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_3
TEXT: All things have two sides. Focusing on only one of those sides is unlikely to yield good results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let us look to the future. Experience suggests we may soon receive word from the professor regarding Candela or the last Team GO Rocket leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_5

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: We’ve got a fresh lead, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: The latest intel suggests that Cliff has been training like there’s no tomorrow, and supposedly he’s got a new strategy: all-out attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Blanche has had a research breakthrough and wants to cultivate the abilities of Pokémon with potent defense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: Attack and defense, opposite but complementary—just like last time. I bet we can learn more about this duality if we dig in a bit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_1_dialogue_5
TEXT: On that note, let’s hear it—which of their strategies do you want to investigate further?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_1
TEXT: Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. Your assistance will be most welcome.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_2
TEXT: My research has led me to one conclusion: obvious though it may seem, the surest way to win a battle is to never lose it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_3
TEXT: In other words, if your Pokémon never faints, victory is the only possible outcome.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_4
TEXT: Lapras and I have begun testing several methodologies that maximize its defense potential. Would you and your Pokémon partners like to join us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hey, watch where you’re standing! I’m training here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_2
TEXT: The full-power attacks I’m working on will make Team GO Rocket unstoppable. What's with that look? Don’t believe it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_3
TEXT: It’s easy. You get your Pokémon to hit so hard that their opponents never even get a CHANCE to hit back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_4
TEXT: Hmph, not that it matters for you. I doubt a weakling like you could ever get your Pokémon to pull an attack like that off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_5
TEXT: And that means if you’re hanging around here, you’re holding me back. So beat it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_1
TEXT: Congratulations on a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_2
TEXT: My analysis of recent battles has disproven my previous theory—though the fault does not lie with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_3
TEXT: I had Lapras so focused on defense that I neglected to give it opportunities to attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_4
