RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve been reviewing Spark’s latest report.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_2
TEXT: He found Pokémon in habitats that very much aren’t where they’d normally be observed, similar to when we were chasing down Sierra before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_3
TEXT: Ice-type Pokémon in hot locales, and Fire-type Pokémon in cold locales... Why could something so unexpected like this be happening?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_3_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’m going to review the data and mull things over. I’ll let you know right away if I get any good brain waves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_1
TEXT: You know what I find interesting, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_2
TEXT: After analyzing the data, it becomes clear that the radical shift in weather means we’re confronting an even bigger unknown than we thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_3
TEXT: Strange weather, Pokémon in unusual places, and the Team GO Rocket Leaders showing up... There has to be something that ties it all together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let’s make sure we’re ready for when our friends report back in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_4_dialogue_5
TEXT: Whatever’s causing this weird weather seems like it’s just getting started. And that means that prime opportunities for research lie ahead!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: I just heard from Spark, %PLAYERNAME%! He just found a research hot spot—literally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: The place is supposed to be pretty toasty, but reportedly the area has plenty of Ice-type Pokémon despite the heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: And that’s not the only news. We’ve pinpointed Sierra’s location too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: She’s been spotted out in the snow, amidst—bafflingly—Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_1_dialogue_5
TEXT: Which lead do you want to follow? Would you rather help Spark with his research, or track down Sierra?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_1
TEXT: Fancy seeing you out here in the cold, dear. These Fire types aren’t the only ones whose presence is curious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’m aware that your professor has been attempting to track me down, but I would love to complete my mission. Ideally without your presence.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_3
TEXT: The weather is frigid. This is no place for your frailty.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_sierra_dialogue_4
TEXT: Leave, or I’m afraid I’ll need to take further action. I prefer you simply stop interfering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_1
TEXT: Heyyy, %PLAYERNAME%! How’s it going?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_2
TEXT: Me? I just got back from the beach, and—get this—so did all these Ice-type Pokémon! Weird with the heat, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_3
TEXT: It was fun to beach it up with some new friends, but both the professor and I would love to figure out why they were there in the first place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_2_spark_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let’s kick back, relax, and learn a thing or two about staying frosty.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_1
TEXT: Congratulations on a display of mild competence. That’s more than I can say for your friends, especially that airhead, Spark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_2
TEXT: The cause of this phenomenon must be something we haven’t encountered before. However, I don't recall agreeing to share the rest of my report with you, darling.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_3
TEXT: If you truly think you know what you’re doing, why not continue your little investigation on your own? Now, you must excuse me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’m done with this mission—and with you. Ta-ta, %PLAYERNAME%. Don’t think I’ll go easy on you the next time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_1
TEXT: Radical researching! Not only do I feel totally refreshed, but I learned a lot from my beachside retreat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_2
TEXT: Based on this data, the weird weather that’s been happening lately isn’t linked to anything we’ve seen before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_3
TEXT: It’s electrifying, right? Like we’re incubating a mysterious Egg. Who knows what’s going to pop out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_spark_dialogue_4
