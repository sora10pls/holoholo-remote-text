RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_03
TEXT: A challenge you’re ready for, I have no doubt.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_02
