RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! As great as it is to see you, I have troubling news to share.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been receiving reports of light and shadow behaving oddly in major cities around the globe, and now it looks like it’s happening everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_2
TEXT: It’s a strange phenomenon, and I’m worried about the safety of our world and all the Pokémon in it.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_3
TEXT: And as one of the most skilled and dedicated Trainers I know, I’ll need your help to shine some light on this mystery.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_0_4
TEXT: This is a crucial mission, %PLAYERNAME%. Can I count on you?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Given all the bizarre occurrences taking place worldwide, we need to prioritize ensuring the safety and well-being of the Pokémon in our area!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_1
TEXT: And the best way for us to do that is for you to catch and befriend as many of them as you can!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_2
TEXT: That way you can monitor their behavior firsthand and report any unusual findings.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_1_3
TEXT: How about it? Ready to get out there and catch some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for tending to all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m still getting reports of shadows throughout the world behaving unusually, so it looks like our work has just begun.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_1
TEXT: I’d like you to survey the area and pay particular attention to any shadows you come across.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_2
TEXT: And while you’re out there, why not take the opportunity to hatch some Eggs?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_2_3
TEXT: Exploring is a great way to incubate Eggs and discover new Pokémon that could potentially aid our cause.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Our investigation has yielded exciting results!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_1
TEXT: Given all our observations, the only logical conclusion is that we have Marshadow on our hands!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_2
TEXT: Marshadow is a unique Pokémon with the ability to conceal itself within any shadow.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_3
TEXT: It’s likely feeling very cautious right now. We need to consider our next steps carefully and approach from a place of understanding.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_3_4
TEXT: But I’m confident that with your patience and skills as a Trainer, you’ll be able to coax it out of the shadows!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_1
TEXT: Your efforts to create a comfortable environment for Marshadow are paying off.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_2

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_4_3
TEXT: Let’s continue to foster a welcoming atmosphere. With any luck, we’ll make a breakthrough!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_0

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_1
TEXT: We’ve successfully unraveled the mystery of the shadows, and it’s all thanks to your tireless efforts.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_2
TEXT: On top of that, we’ve made a brand-new friend! I’m sure that together, we’ll make even more incredible discoveries that continue strengthening the bond between humans and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_1_ticket_5_3
TEXT: I can hardly wait to see what exciting challenges await us next!

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_0
TEXT: Your arrival is well timed, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_1
TEXT: Necrozma is emerging from the Ultra Wormhole that marks the sky, and its hunger for light threatens to upset the delicate balance of your world.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_2
TEXT: I find myself in need of your skills and courage.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_0_3

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_1
TEXT: As you engage with this formidable Pokémon, anticipate its actions and adapt your tactics accordingly.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_2
TEXT: Rely on the strength of your bond with your Pokémon. Trust in their abilities and the power of your shared resolve.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_2_3
TEXT: Your skill and determination as a Trainer will be greatly challenged, but I am confident in your success. Until we next meet.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_branching_text
TEXT: I have narrowed my focus, %PLAYERNAME%. I suspect we may learn much from certain Pokémon my radar has detected in the area. Which do you prefer to investigate?

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_0
TEXT: A wise decision. Studying Crabrawler will help ensure our readiness for the impending confrontation with Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_1
TEXT: Crabrawler is a Fighting-type Pokémon known for having pincers suited to both offense and defense.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_crabrawler_branch_1_2
TEXT: Observing these pincers may prove valuable in our forthcoming encounter with Necrozma.

TEXT: By studying Crabrawler’s techniques , we can gain insight into how to approach our own strategy.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_0

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ducklett_branch_1_1

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_1

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_2
TEXT: This distinctive behavior causes other Pokémon to maintain a cautious distance.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_emolga_branch_1_3
TEXT: By studying Emolga’s tactics, we can gain insight into how to approach our own strategy.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_0
TEXT: Your presence brings me great relief, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_1
TEXT: The threat that Necrozma’s hunger for light poses cannot be overstated.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_2
TEXT: Observe the cracks in the sky. Similar phenomena have been reported around the globe.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_3
TEXT: Necrozma emerges even now. Your world looks to us for a solution.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_4
TEXT: I believe that you, %PLAYERNAME%, are the only one with the skills and compassion necessary to confront Necrozma and catch it.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_0_5
TEXT: Let us combine our efforts to face this challenge. Together, I am certain we will triumph over even the darkest of threats.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_0
TEXT: Your return brings me joy, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish to illuminate what I know about Necrozma’s ability to fuse.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_1
TEXT: By fusing with Solgaleo or Lunala, it is able to change form and become either Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_2
TEXT: We still have much to learn about this ability. I am eager to witness its results.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_4_3
TEXT: Your journey with Necrozma is far from over. You have my thanks for rising to the challenges of better understanding this fascinating Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_branching_text
TEXT: I commend your remarkable feat. With Necrozma under your guidance, I encourage you to explore the mysterious phenomenon known as fusion. I see two paths forward—one of light, and one of shadows.

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_1_0

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_1_4

RESOURCE ID: global_day_2_ticket_lunala_branch_2_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Question—have you been by the woods at all lately?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_1
TEXT: I ask because a nearby forest has been looking pretty lush lately.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_2
TEXT: It reminded me of some old stories I came across back in my student days.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_3
TEXT: There are accounts from different eras that describe trees flourishing in the forest along with the appearance of a particular Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_4
TEXT: I wonder if any of those tales are true. I’ll have to dig into my notes and find the name of the Pokémon they’re referring to.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Have you had a chance to observe any of the surrounding locations?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_1
TEXT: Whenever I find myself getting lost in my notes, I like to take breaks near trees in the area.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_2
TEXT: Oh, speaking of my notes—the Pokémon in the stories I was talking about earlier turns out to have been Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_3
TEXT: And—this is the really juicy part—Celebi is known as the Time Travel Pokémon. It came here from the future by crossing over time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_4
TEXT: Sounds right out of a myth, right? Let’s keep investigating and see if the phenomenon I observed is connected to Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I was just looking for you! Did you turn up anything interesting in your own investigation?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_1
TEXT: I actually think I spotted Celebi in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_2
TEXT: It seemed like it was bolstering the grass and trees around it—and that matches what’s recorded about it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_3
TEXT: Its coloring was different than expected, though. What could that mean?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_4
TEXT: Whatever the answer, we ought to keep an eye out for our fantastical forest friend.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_0
TEXT: I’ve been looking inward a lot lately—meditative, even. I wonder if it’s due to Celebi’s presence?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_1
TEXT: They say that it only appears during peaceful times...

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_2
TEXT: Well, if that’s true, I hope it stays with us for a long time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_3
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? Have you felt inspired by the calm?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_4
TEXT: It might be nice to spend some time basking in the serenity around us with your buddy!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_0
TEXT: I saw Celebi again! It flew off when I tried to approach, but I found an egg near where I spotted it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_1
TEXT: According to my research, Celebi is said to leave behind an egg it brought from the future, so I can’t wait to study this one!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_2
TEXT: This is a good sign! We’re going to have another encounter with Celebi—I can just feel it!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_3
TEXT: You keep up the good work exploring—and make sure you’re prepared for when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_4
TEXT: It’s no small feat to catch a Mythical Pokémon like Celebi, but I’m sure you have what it takes!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_0
TEXT: Yes! You’ve done brilliantly, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m so proud of you for seeing this task through.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_1
TEXT: And what a worthwhile task it was! Just look at the hue on your new friend there—this is a Shiny Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_2
TEXT: It’s thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_3
TEXT: And if you ask me, your contribution towards that future will be nothing short of mythical!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_4
TEXT: Make sure to take some time to celebrate with your new friend, Trainer. And until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_0
TEXT: Perfect timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve got an electrifying adventure lined up for you today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been monitoring some nearby waters and have picked up intriguing electrical signals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_2
TEXT: If my hunch is correct, we’ve got a school of the Electric-type Pokémon Tynamo on our hands! Well, maybe not literally on our hands—they’re pretty zappy—but you know what I mean.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_3
TEXT: See if you can spot any Tynamo out there. Even better if you can bring one back for us to study up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see I was right to charge you with researching Tynamo today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_1
TEXT: I just learned that one Tynamo alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_2
TEXT: And things get even more shocking once Tynamo evolves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Tynamo into Eelektrik so we can study it together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektrik has me en-wrap-tured! Get it? Because they coil around their prey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_1
TEXT: Anyway... If you look closely, you can see these circular patterns along Eelektrik’s body are actually electricity-generating organs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_2
TEXT: That’s why I always pack a pair of rubber gloves. You never know when you’ll be handling Electric-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_3
TEXT: Now, I think you’re ready to take this research up a notch and evolve your Eelektrik into Eelektross!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_0
TEXT: Wow! What an achievement, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektross has me totally amped!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Eelektross’ fangs have electricity running through them? It makes me glad I didn’t become a Pokémon dentist! Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_2
TEXT: The fact that you’ve befriended such a phenomenal Electric-type Pokémon is grounds for celebration, I say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_3
TEXT: Keep up the fantastic work out there. I’m sure I’ll see you again soon. Until then, let’s GO!
