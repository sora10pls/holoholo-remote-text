TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: I was out for my daily stroll when I stumbled upon a group of fascinating Pokémon I’d never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: I’ve been poring over my research materials, but so far I haven’t turned up any records about these particular Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: And so, I turn to the power of networking! I’m hoping that I can unravel this mystery by reaching out to my fellow Pokémon Professors. Maybe one of them will know something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_1_dialogue_5
TEXT: So please give me a moment to organize my notes, and then we’ll get to know these Pokémon better together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2
TEXT: Galar Calling (2/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_1
TEXT: So Grookey caught your eye! I’ve learned that this spirited little Grass type strikes everything in sight with its trusty stick.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_2
TEXT: The rhythms it makes with that stick grow more lively as it has more and more fun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2a_dialogue_3
TEXT: I’ll bet Grookey would make an incredible partner for someone who likes to dance! So shimmy on out there and find one! ...If shimmying is your thing, that is.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Aha, the fiery Scorbunny has “sparked” your interest, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve noted that this energetic Fire type does warm-up exercises to help heat up its body and unleash its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_3
TEXT: Sounds like having Scorbunny by your side would give you the perfect workout buddy! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Head on out there and make yourself a fiery new friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_1
TEXT: Sobble is a wonderful choice, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve learned that this Water type has a unique defense mechanism: it bursts into tears when frightened.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_3
TEXT: Oh, but these waterworks don’t just soften hearts—Sobble’s tears pack the punch of 100 onions, causing its attackers to weep!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_2c_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about you track down a Sobble so you’ve got a shoulder to cry on? Er, to...make you cry on? I’ll work on that one...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3
TEXT: Galar Calling (3/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_1
TEXT: You got one! My curious side loves seeing Grookey up close, but the rest of me thinks we ought to steer clear of its stick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve got good news, too—a fellow professor shared their research with me. Did you know that when Grookey evolves into Thwackey, it gains a second stick?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_3
TEXT: It makes skillful use of those twin sticks not only to drum out rapid beats, but also to pummel opponents in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3a_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about we try to help your little rockstar evolve so we can learn even more about Thwackey’s musical talents?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Hello to you, and hello to your new friend, Scorbunny! Excellent work catching it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve got good news, too—a fellow professor shared their research with me. I was just reading up on Scorbunny’s Evolution, Raboot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_3
TEXT: Did you know that they kick berries right off tree branches and juggle them with their feet? It’s a way to practice footwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Now that’s something I’ve just got to see! And who wouldn’t want the chance to enjoy some delicious berries in the name of research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3b_dialogue_5
TEXT: How about you help your Scorbunny evolve into Raboot?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_1
TEXT: Now that you’ve made a new friend in Sobble, let’s take a few moments to indulge in the delights of learning!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_2
TEXT: And on that front, I’ve got news that WON’T make you cry—a fellow professor sent me their research. From it, I learned that when Sobble evolves into Drizzile, it becomes quite lazy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_3
TEXT: But don’t let that laziness fool you. Drizzile is highly intelligent and will defend its territory by laying traps for its enemies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_3c_dialogue_4
TEXT: A clever Pokémon like that sounds like something we need to know more about, so why don’t you work on evolving your Sobble?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4
TEXT: Galar Calling (4/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! And welcome to your new pal Thwackey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’ve been reading, and I’ve found some great stuff on Thwackey’s Evolution, Rillaboom!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_3
TEXT: Apparently, when two of them meet, they’ll engage in a drumming battle to decide who will lead their troop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4a_dialogue_4
TEXT: How about we do some firsthand observation and help your Thwackey evolve? I’ll bet you and Rillaboom would really hit it off!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s quite an impressive Raboot! I bet it’s really been heating things up with its fancy footwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_2
TEXT: But save your applause until you see its final Evolution, Cinderace. It juggles pebbles with its feet and turns them into blazing soccer balls that scorch opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_3
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to be goalie—or the net, for that matter—with Cinderace on the field! But I do think we should “net” ourselves some new data and evolve your Raboot into Cinderace.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4b_dialogue_4
TEXT: Just think of the fiery spectacle you’ll get to enjoy alongside your new friend!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_1
TEXT: You’re back! And you’ve got a Drizzile in tow! Let’s take a closer look.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_2
TEXT: Did you know that its long, slimy tongue can move at blinding speeds to attack enemies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_3
TEXT: And when it evolves into Inteleon, it gains even more incredible abilities—like fingertips that can shoot water at Mach 3!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_4
TEXT: That sounds like something we ought to see. Why don’t you continue your adventure and evolve your Drizzile into Inteleon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_4c_dialogue_5
TEXT: It’ll be an incredible scientific opportunity to see those amazing abilities firsthand—just remember to wear a raincoat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_2
TEXT: I was investigating the power emanating from one of those strange lights that appeared—and you won’t believe the colossal discovery I made!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_3
TEXT: There’s an enormous Pokémon in it! Truly HUMUNGOUS! And it’s not the only one—I’ve received reports of these massive Pokémon showing up all over the place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_5_dialogue_4
TEXT: So how about it? Are you up for meeting some supersized Pokémon and getting to the bottom of a BIG mystery?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6
TEXT: Galar Calling (6/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_1
TEXT: We’ve made a massive breakthrough, %PLAYERNAME%! My fellow Pokémon Professors and I have confirmed that we’ve been witnessing the Dynamax phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_2
TEXT: And on top of that, we’ve learned that the locations with the strange lights are an entirely new occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_3
TEXT: Honestly, those Power Spots give me tingles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_6_dialogue_4
TEXT: Further, Power Spots are definitely related to Dynamaxing. This is truly fascinating stuff, my friend! Let’s go size up the situation and gather more data.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7
TEXT: Galar Calling (7/19)

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, this Dynamax discovery of ours is no small thing. It’s as though every detail we learn leads to new questions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_2
TEXT: How did the Power Spots form? How much stronger are these Pokémon? Do Dynamax Pokémon have equally “maxed” appetites? Hoo boy, we might need to stock up on Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_3
TEXT: In any case, we need to keep thinking big and tracking down these gargantuan Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_7_dialogue_4
