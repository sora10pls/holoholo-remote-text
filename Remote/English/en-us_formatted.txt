RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_02
TEXT: As I said, there’s quite a surge of them in the vicinity. I wonder how strong of a current they could all make together!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_01
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’s your training going?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_02
TEXT: I’ve been thinking. With all there is to learn, how does a person know when they’ve mastered something?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_03
TEXT: Just a little food for thought. Anyway, did you notice anything interesting out there?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_04
TEXT: I was struck by the high number of Electric- and Poison-type Pokémon buzzing and bubbling about.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_05
TEXT: In fact, speaking of measuring mastery—this is an excellent opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_branch
TEXT: This is your chance to put your training to the test! Which path will you take to prove your prowess?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_01
TEXT: All right! You’ve picked your poison! Er, Poison type, that is.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_02
TEXT: They say you should avoid toxic people, but learning about Poison-type Pokémon is sure to be both fun AND useful!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_03
TEXT: A challenge you’re ready for, I have no doubt.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_04
TEXT: Why don’t you start by collecting data on the Poison-type Pokémon in the area.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_01
TEXT: Just look at all the Poison-type Pokémon you’ve caught. And what excellent snapshots!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_02
TEXT: I’m confident you could also master Pokémon photography. You should give it a shot!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_03
TEXT: Ahem. Now that you’ve caught some Poison-type Pokémon, it’s time to get to know them better.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_04
TEXT: Sharing some Berries is an effective way to build your friendship. Let me know how it goes!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_01
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Poison-type Pokémon look like great pals already.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_02
TEXT: Poison types are especially strong against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokémon, but do you know what their weakness is?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_03
TEXT: Here’s a hint: these Pokémon may “soil” a Poison-type Pokémon’s victory!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_01
TEXT: Venom...denim? No, that—ah! %PLAYERNAME%! I certainly wasn’t practicing my puns. Anyway, your Poison types are looking stronger than ever!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_02
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to face off against your team. That is, unless I knew what they were weak against. Any ideas?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_03
TEXT: Poison-type Pokémon are weak against both Psychic and Ground types, and your Golem has ground covered!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_04
TEXT: Why don’t you take it out for a spin and see for yourself? Let’s rock and roll!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_01
TEXT: Phenomenal work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_00_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_05

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_02
