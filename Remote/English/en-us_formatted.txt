RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_01_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_02_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_03_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_electric_04_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_01
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’s your training going?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_02
TEXT: I’ve been thinking. With all there is to learn, how does a person know when they’ve mastered something?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_03
TEXT: Just a little food for thought. Anyway, did you notice anything interesting out there?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_04
TEXT: I was struck by the high number of Electric- and Poison-type Pokémon buzzing and bubbling about.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_05
TEXT: In fact, speaking of measuring mastery—this is an excellent opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_intro_00_branch
TEXT: This is your chance to put your training to the test! Which path will you take to prove your prowess?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_01
TEXT: All right! You’ve picked your poison! Er, Poison type, that is.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_02
TEXT: They say you should avoid toxic people, but learning about Poison-type Pokémon is sure to be both fun AND useful!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_03
TEXT: A challenge you’re ready for, I have no doubt.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_00_04
TEXT: Why don’t you start by collecting data on the Poison-type Pokémon in the area.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_01
TEXT: Just look at all the Poison-type Pokémon you’ve caught. And what excellent snapshots!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_02
TEXT: I’m confident you could also master Pokémon photography. You should give it a shot!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_03
TEXT: Ahem. Now that you’ve caught some Poison-type Pokémon, it’s time to get to know them better.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_01_04
TEXT: Sharing some Berries is an effective way to build your friendship. Let me know how it goes!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_01
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Poison-type Pokémon look like great pals already.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_02
TEXT: Poison types are especially strong against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokémon, but do you know what their weakness is?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_03
TEXT: Here’s a hint: these Pokémon may “soil” a Poison-type Pokémon’s victory!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_02_04
TEXT: Heh. You work on that, and I’ll work on getting some new material. You’ve got this!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_01
TEXT: Venom...denim? No, that—ah! %PLAYERNAME%! I certainly wasn’t practicing my puns. Anyway, your Poison types are looking stronger than ever!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_02
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to face off against your team. That is, unless I knew what they were weak against. Any ideas?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_03
TEXT: Poison-type Pokémon are weak against both Psychic and Ground types, and your Golem has ground covered!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_03_04
TEXT: Why don’t you take it out for a spin and see for yourself? Let’s rock and roll!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_01
TEXT: Phenomenal work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_02
TEXT: Please, take this medal as a token of your mastery of Poison types. I couldn’t be more proud.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_03
TEXT: Your skills are as potent as the Poison-type Pokémon you’re training.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_04
TEXT: With your guidance, they’ll be the bane of any Pokémon they battle.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_global_sr_poison_04_05
TEXT: Now, I’ve got just a few more research items on the agenda. I know I can count on you!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_00_01
TEXT: Can you believe the surge of Electric-type Pokémon in the vicinity?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_electric_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_01
TEXT: You did it! I just knew you’d master both Poison- and Electric-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_02
TEXT: And you even caught a Dynamax Toxtricity—wow! Did you know that it has an electrical organ on its chest?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_03
TEXT: While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_finale_00_05

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_intro_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_01
TEXT: All right! You’ve picked your poison! Er, Poison type, that is!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_00_02

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_03

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_01_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_01
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Poison-type Pokémon look like great pals already.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_02
TEXT: Poison types are especially strong against Fairy- and Grass-type Pokémon, but do you know what their weakness is?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_03
TEXT: Here’s a hint: these Pokémon may “soil” a Poison-type Pokémon’s victory!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_02_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_01
TEXT: Venom...denim? No, that—ah! %PLAYERNAME%! I certainly wasn’t practicing my puns. Anyway, your Poison types are looking stronger than ever!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_02
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to face off against your team. That is, unless I knew what they were weak against. Any ideas?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_03
TEXT: Poison-type Pokémon are weak against both Psychic and Ground types, and your Golem has ground covered!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_03_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_irl_sr_poison_04_04

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_02
TEXT: I have something exciting to show you. This, my friend, is a GO Safari Ball.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_03
TEXT: Take note—they’re not like normal Poké Balls! They don’t last forever, so you need to use them before they disappear.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_00_04
TEXT: They should be useful if you come across any exceptionally strong Pokémon. Try them out and report back!

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_01
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you find anything interesting?

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_02
TEXT: And me? I’m glad you asked! I’ve spotted some unusually powerful Pokémon roaming about.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_03
TEXT: These mighty Pokémon are fully evolved, are larger and stronger than most other Pokémon of their species, and are more challenging to catch.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_04
TEXT: If you can find some of these mighty Pokémon, GO Safari Balls should be a big help.

RESOURCE ID: go_wild_2024_safari_ball_intro_01_05

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_1
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—I’ve got news. The leaders of Team GO Rocket—Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra—have been spotted in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_2
TEXT: We still don’t know what their plans are for the Dynamax phenomenon, but whatever they are, those three will be carrying them out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_3
TEXT: Follow the leaders and find out what they’re up to—and stop them, if necessary!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_10_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’ll be mapping out our next move—I think I’ll have something by the time you’ve dealt with the leaders. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_11_dialogue_1
TEXT: Bad news, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_11_dialogue_2
TEXT: It looks like my suspicions were correct—this goes all the way to the top: Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_11_dialogue_3
TEXT: We’ve got to put a stop to his schemes, and I know you’re the perfect Trainer to do just that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_11_dialogue_4
TEXT: Go and show him what you’re made of!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_12_dialogue_1
TEXT: Excellent work! Couldn’t have done better myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_12_dialogue_2
TEXT: I’m too familiar with Team GO Rocket to believe we’ve heard the last of Giovanni, but you’ve definitely thrown a wrench into their plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_12_dialogue_3
TEXT: I want to check in on nearby Dynamax Pokémon, so please take care of any Team GO Rocket Grunts still hanging around.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_1
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! The Dynamax Pokémon are safe now, thanks to your courage and skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_2
TEXT: We’ll need to keep a close eye on Team GO Rocket as we keep up our research on the Dynamax phenomenon, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_3
TEXT: Call it a professor’s intuition, but I’ve got a feeling a gigantic discovery is just around the corner.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_13_dialogue_4
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I have MASSIVE news to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_2
TEXT: We’ve come across even more enormous Pokémon—and what’s more, they appear to have changed appearance altogether!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_3
TEXT: There are still a bunch of questions to be answered, but thankfully I have an expert team—you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_14_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’m going to dive into some research, and while I do, I’ll need you to investigate in the field. With your help, we’ll get to the bottom of this supersized mystery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_1
TEXT: I hope you’re ready for big updates, %PLAYERNAME%! Based on my research, I believe we might be witnessing what’s called the “Gigantamax” phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_2
TEXT: Gigantamaxed Pokémon seem to not only have altered size and appearance, but they also gain the ability to use a new move. This move seems to be unique to a given species of Gigantamax Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_3
TEXT: We have to gather more data from these Pokémon at Power Spots. It’s a tall order, but I know you’re up to it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_15_dialogue_4
TEXT: I’ll keep up the research at the lab while you’re out investigating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_16_dialogue_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_16_dialogue_2
TEXT: While you were out, a fellow professor confirmed my hypothesis—we’re observing the Gigantamax phenomenon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_16_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can you imagine the incredible new Pokémon forms waiting to be discovered? The possibilities are as enormous as the Pokémon themselves! I’m getting chills!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_16_dialogue_4
TEXT: Nothing beats knowing there’s so much more for us to learn, and I can’t imagine a better research partner than you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_17_dialogue_1
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_17_dialogue_2
TEXT: Your tireless efforts and incredible discoveries these past weeks have advanced our understanding of the Gigantamax phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_17_dialogue_3
TEXT: You've more than earned a well-deserved break. Why don't you take some time to relax and recharge?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_17_dialogue_4
TEXT: Perhaps a peaceful stroll or a quiet picnic in your favourite spot. And don't forget to bring along your Pokémon buddy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_18_dialogue_1
TEXT: Just when we think we've seen it all, the Pokémon world surprises us with something as incredible as Gigantamax.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_18_dialogue_2
TEXT: Each discovery truly feels like we're writing a new chapter in the grand book of Pokémon research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_18_dialogue_3
TEXT: Thank you for all of your hard work. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad you’re here. I’ve been bombarded with reports of Team GO Rocket sightings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_2
TEXT: Those troublemakers are up to something. I’m sure of it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_3
TEXT: Are you able to investigate?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_8_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let me know what you find out, and I’ll keep you updated on my end. And stay safe out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_1
TEXT: Glad you’re back. I’ve been reviewing these Team GO Rocket reports, and I think I’ve pieced together something troubling.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_2
TEXT: The evidence suggests that they’re trying to take advantage of the Dynamax phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can you imagine the chaos if they could harness that kind of power? We can’t let that happen!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_16_first_partner_9_dialogue_4
