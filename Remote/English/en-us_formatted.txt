RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_00_01

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_00_02
TEXT: And even more intriguing, these anomalies appear to move around at the drop of a hat, defying the laws of science! Not to worry, though—I’ve already cooked up a hypothesis!

RESOURCE ID: go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_00_03

TEXT: Go ahead and take a deep breath in! Smell that sweet scent wafting in the air?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_2
TEXT: There’s no deceiving a Pokémon Professor’s nose! That lovely aroma’s all the proof we need that the Grass-type Bounsweet must be nearby. And in great numbers, by the scent of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_3
TEXT: Now go on, follow your nose! Try and bring a Bounsweet back so we can study it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_0
TEXT: I’d recognize that smell of success a mile away, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve happened on a bounty of Bounsweet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_1
TEXT: Here’s a fact: we’re not the only ones interested in Bounsweet. Bird Pokémon are always after them, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_2
TEXT: One fact isn’t enough for you? Well, did you know that Bounsweet secrete a sweet—and delicious—sweat? Now you do! I sure wish I smelled that good!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. In any event, why don’t you head out and catch some more so we can keep our sweet new friends safe?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’re acquainted with the delightful Bounsweet, let’s familiarize ourselves with its Evolution, Steenee.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_2
TEXT: Keep a sharp eye out for a Steenee performing its signature twirl. When they spin like that, they’re spreading their amazing scent far and wide.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_3
TEXT: Just a whiff will give you a surge of happiness, in fact. So what are you waiting for, %PLAYERNAME%? We’ve got joy to...well, enjoy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_0
TEXT: Wow! What an impressive Tsareena!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_1
TEXT: But make sure you keep your guard up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_2
TEXT: Tsareena’s kick can hit hard enough to take out even the toughest kickboxing champ.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_3
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for all the assists today, %PLAYERNAME%. Stay sharp and keep well out of kicking distance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, hi! It’s pretty hot out here, don’t you think? The heat must be coming from all the Cyndaquil running about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_1
TEXT: Are you familiar with it? It’s a Fire-type Pokémon known for its timid nature.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_2
TEXT: Since they scare easily, they’re usually found curled up in a little ball—and they’ll flare the flames on their backs to protect themselves when attacked!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you grab a pocket fan to stay cool and try to catch one of these fascinating Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_0
TEXT: That’s quite a Cyndaquil you’ve befriended, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re on fire—er, not literally, thankfully.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_1
TEXT: Let me reward you with some fun tidbits! Did you know that a Cyndaquil’s flames burn hottest when they’re startled?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_2
TEXT: And its Evolution, Quilava, will turn its back on opponents just to show off how ferociously its fire blazes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_3
TEXT: Let’s evolve your Cyndaquil into a Quilava. While I’m not jumping at the idea of making it even hotter around here, I AM eager to study the variance in flame intensity as they evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_0
TEXT: Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! Now, let’s take a closer look at your Quilava. You’re on a hot streak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_1
TEXT: As I mentioned, Quilava tend to use the heat of their flames to intimidate foes. Those flames burn even stronger when it prepares to fight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_2
TEXT: Your Quilava seems like a real firebrand! I bet it’ll be even more of a force to be reckoned with once it evolves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_3
TEXT: On that note, let’s turn the thermostat up to max—evolve your Quilava into Typhlosion! There’s learning to be had!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_0
TEXT: Oh! I was wondering why I was feeling so toasty, but now I see—you’re back with Typhlosion! Let’s take a moment to marvel at its raw power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_1
TEXT: When a Typhlosion’s rage peaks, it gets so hot that it’ll send anything that touches it up in flames!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_2
TEXT: I’m pretty sure my eyebrows are getting singed, but it’s totally worth it for an up-close encounter with such an awe-inspiring Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_3
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next adventure—stay cool!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_0
TEXT: Oh! Hi, %PLAYERNAME%! Don’t mind the mess...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_1
TEXT: I was just enjoying the shade and jotting down a few notes when I noticed some slime on my coat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_2
TEXT: Research opportunities come in unexpected forms, and I have an inkling this residue belongs to a certain clingy culprit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_3
TEXT: While I figure out how to clean this up, could you look around and let me know if you observe anything interesting in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_0
TEXT: Aha! I knew it! This goo came from Goomy, the Soft Tissue Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_1
TEXT: Goomy tend to live in damp, shady places so their bodies don’t dry out. I should’ve watched where I was sitting!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to learn more about Goomy and its Evolutions while we have this opportunity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_3
TEXT: Given that you seem better than me at staying slime-free, would you mind evolving Goomy into Sliggoo?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_0
TEXT: You’re a slime savant, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_1
TEXT: But take extra care around your new Sliggoo. Its mucus can dissolve pretty much anything.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_2
TEXT: Also, I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s worth mentioning that Sliggoo are known to have trouble drawing a line between friends and food.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_3
TEXT: Might be worth seeing if yours is ready to evolve. It could save you the trouble of fending off a well-intentioned but melty hug!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_0
TEXT: Simply slime-tastic, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_1
TEXT: Goodra is an amazingly friendly Pokémon with a penchant for hugging its Trainer. And yes, before you ask—that can make things pretty gooey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_2
TEXT: This Pokémon isn’t all slime and rainbows though. The strikes from Goodra’s horns land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_3
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for sticking with this research! I hope you and your Goodra stay together for many years to come!
