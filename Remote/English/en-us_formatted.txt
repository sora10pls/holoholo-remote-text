RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Question—have you been by the woods at all lately?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_1
TEXT: I ask because a nearby forest has been looking pretty lush lately.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_2
TEXT: It reminded me of some old stories I came across back in my student days.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_3
TEXT: There are accounts from different eras that describe trees flourishing in the forest along with the appearance of a particular Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_1_4
TEXT: I wonder if any of those tales are true. I’ll have to dig into my notes and find the name of the Pokémon they’re referring to.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Have you had a chance to observe any of the surrounding locations?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_1
TEXT: Whenever I find myself getting lost in my notes, I like to take breaks near trees in the area.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_2
TEXT: Oh, speaking of my notes—the Pokémon in the stories I was talking about earlier turns out to have been Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_3
TEXT: And—this is the really juicy part—Celebi is known as the Time Travel Pokémon. It came here from the future by crossing over time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_2_4
TEXT: Sounds right out of a myth, right? Let’s keep investigating and see if the phenomenon I observed is connected to Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I was just looking for you! Did you turn up anything interesting in your own investigation?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_1
TEXT: I actually think I spotted Celebi in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_2
TEXT: It seemed like it was bolstering the grass and trees around it—and that matches what’s recorded about it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_3
TEXT: Its coloring was different than expected, though. What could that mean?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_3_4
TEXT: Whatever the answer, we ought to keep an eye out for our fantastical forest friend.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_0
TEXT: I’ve been looking inward a lot lately—meditative, even. I wonder if it’s due to Celebi’s presence?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_1
TEXT: They say that it only appears during peaceful times...

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_2
TEXT: Well, if that’s true, I hope it stays with us for a long time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_3
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? Have you felt inspired by the calm?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_4_4
TEXT: It might be nice to spend some time basking in the serenity around us with your buddy!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_0
TEXT: I saw Celebi again! It flew off when I tried to approach, but I found an egg near where I spotted it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_1
TEXT: According to my research, Celebi is said to leave behind an egg it brought from the future, so I can’t wait to study this one!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_2
TEXT: This is a good sign! We’re going to have another encounter with Celebi—I can just feel it!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_3
TEXT: You keep up the good work exploring—and make sure you’re prepared for when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_5_4
TEXT: It’s no small feat to catch a Mythical Pokémon like Celebi, but I’m sure you have what it takes!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_0
TEXT: Yes! You’ve done brilliantly, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m so proud of you for seeing this task through.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_1
TEXT: And what a worthwhile task it was! Just look at the hue on your new friend there—this is a Shiny Celebi!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_2
TEXT: It’s thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_3
TEXT: And if you ask me, your contribution towards that future will be nothing short of mythical!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_dialogue_whisper_woods_6_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_2
TEXT: If my hunch is correct, we’ve got a school of the Electric-type Pokémon Tynamo on our hands! Well, maybe not literally on our hands—they’re pretty zappy—but you know what I mean.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_3
TEXT: See if you can spot any Tynamo out there. Even better if you can bring one back for us to study up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see I was right to charge you with researching Tynamo today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_1
TEXT: I just learned that one Tynamo alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_2
TEXT: And things get even more shocking once Tynamo evolves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Tynamo into Eelektrik so we can study it together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektrik has me en-wrap-tured! Get it? Because they coil around their prey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_1
TEXT: Anyway... If you look closely, you can see these circular patterns along Eelektrik’s body are actually electricity-generating organs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_2
TEXT: That’s why I always pack a pair of rubber gloves. You never know when you’ll be handling Electric-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_3
