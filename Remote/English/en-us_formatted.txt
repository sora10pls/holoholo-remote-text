RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_00
TEXT: Greetings. Lapras and I were just finishing our latest analysis.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_01
TEXT: A well-balanced approach has proven productive not only in battle, but in other areas as well.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_02
TEXT: We have you to thank, %PLAYERNAME%. Your assistance has allowed us to achieve another breakthrough.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_00
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%. You should know that Cliff has declared his intention to become “the most balanced Trainer ever.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_01
TEXT: I can’t say I’m enthused about an enemy improving his skills, but at least you kept him in check when his reckless training methods could have caused trouble.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_02
TEXT: I genuinely appreciate your support in that matter.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_00
TEXT: Yo, %PLAYERNAME%! I just wrapped up an intense solo mission.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_01
TEXT: I’m still warming up to going solo, but I learn a lot from it, too. Plus, it makes me appreciate being with my team even more.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_02
TEXT: Thanks for everything. Here’s to always being ready to help each other out, whether we’re together or apart!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_00
TEXT: Hey, what’d you say to Arlo earlier? I’ve been hearing he’s working closely with the Grunts—like, cooperatively! That doesn’t sound like him at all.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_01
TEXT: It’s a shame they’re probably getting up to no good. Team GO Rocket are the champs of misplaced passion, huh?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_02
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for handling him. Whatever they try to pull in the future, we’ll stop them together!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_00
TEXT: Heya, %PLAYERNAME%! You keeping frosty?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_01
TEXT: Wild to think how this all kicked off with a beach retreat, huh? I guess things are always going a little haywire around you though, so I can’t say I’m surprised!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_02
TEXT: You’re totally invited to my next hang. Anyways, thanks for always being down for an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_00
TEXT: Hey, thanks for keeping an eye on Sierra earlier, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_01
TEXT: She usually gives everybody a real cold shoulder, so I’m kinda surprised she went easy on you! ...A little easy.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_02
TEXT: She’s still super mean, and, y’know, evil, but hey—we’ll know just how to stop her next time she stirs up trouble!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: We’ve found it at last! Kyurem, the Boundary Pokémon, is almost definitely the cause of the ongoing anomalies we’ve been observing.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: This Legendary Pokémon is missing parts from its body. That may be why it has to stabilize by freezing itself!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Its genes are similar to two other Legendary Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom—and my readings indicate it’s seeking them out as we speak.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: Let’s keep our eyes on the situation, %PLAYERNAME%. Things could spiral out of control if these powerful Pokémon meet.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: So, Kyurem is able to fuse with either the Vast White Pokémon, Reshiram, or the Deep Black Pokémon, Zekrom.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: In doing so, it absorbs the other Pokémon to become White Kyurem or Black Kyurem, respectively.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: That said, we don’t know which of the two Kyurem will go for, and we can only focus on one at a time.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which means that whether we track down Reshiram or Zekrom first, we’re giving Kyurem a chance to find the other.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_04
TEXT: So, would you rather deal with Reshiram and Black Kyurem, or Zekrom and White Kyurem?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_00
TEXT: I’ve heard that Reshiram can shift the atmosphere with heat energy by flaring its tail. And according to myth, when the people of the past became consumed with greed, Reshiram would burn down their kingdoms.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_01
TEXT: Intense stuff. And supposedly, it wants to help anyone wishing to build a world of truth.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_02
TEXT: What would you say your “truth” is, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_03
TEXT: Might be a good idea to get your answer straight before you seek out Reshiram. Don’t get scorched!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_00
TEXT: Zekrom’s tail contains a giant electrical generator. When the interior part of the tail spins like a motor, it creates lightning it can use to blast its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_01
TEXT: And in the past, when people lost sight of the righteousness in their hearts, Zekrom would raze their kingdoms with bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_02
TEXT: Intense stuff. And supposedly, Zekrom also assists those who wish to build an ideal world. What does your ideal world look like, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_03
TEXT: Mine has a comprehensive Pokémon database that lists their habitats and distribution across the world! Get yourself a dream like that, and Zekrom won’t have to zap you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Supposedly, Reshiram and Zekrom were once a single Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: They say that it split apart during some kind of conflict in ancient times.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: I haven’t turned up much on Kyurem’s origins, though—just hearsay from other researchers.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: I do love a good mystery! Anyhow, all three of these powerful Pokémon seem to have a deep connection with Unova.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: Perhaps we can get a better understanding of them by studying other Pokémon first discovered in the region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Oshawott as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_01
TEXT: Oshawott fights by using the scalchop on its stomach like a knife, blocking attacks and then quickly retaliating.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_02
TEXT: They keep honing their skills as they evolve. They seem like a dedicated bunch!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Oshawott and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Snivy as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_01
TEXT: You see its short arms? It’s quite good at using its vines to compensate!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_02
TEXT: They’re known to be intelligent and calm, but they become plenty swift when they’re charged up with sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Snivy and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Tepig as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_01
TEXT: Just don’t underestimate how quick they are! If you don’t watch your lunch carefully, Tepig will be eating it before you can blink!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_02
TEXT: The ravenous little glutton also has a great sense of smell that helps it find food in the wild, which it then crisps up to eat, lickety-split!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Tepig and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_00
TEXT: Good news—we’ve found Reshiram! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Zekrom. Are you ready for what’s next?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_01
TEXT: Once Zekrom and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into Black Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_02
TEXT: From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as Black Kyurem, it would battle to protect an ideal world that will exist in the future for people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_03
TEXT: A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_00
TEXT: Good news—we’ve found Zekrom! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Reshiram. Are you ready for what’s next?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_01
TEXT: Once Reshiram and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into White Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_02
TEXT: From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as White Kyurem, it would strive to protect the world of truth it has foreseen for people and Pokémon alike.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_03
TEXT: A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_00
TEXT: This is incredible... I’ve read about Absofusion, but I never dared to dream I’d witness it firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_01
TEXT: What about you? Did you ever think you'd see something so amazing?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_02
TEXT: People are so passionate about their dreams. I used to wonder if our differences were irreconcilable, but this has shown me that we all complement each other when we’re united.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_03
TEXT: I don’t know if I’ll be around long enough to see the future Kyurem awaits, but I’m excited to work with you to make it a reality!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_02
TEXT: It can launch fireballs from its nose, but don’t expect more than pitch-black smoke if it gets sick.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. So, given what I can glean from my research, Kyurem seems to be looking for something.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: From what I’ve read, it’s waiting for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with either truth or ideals.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: Heady stuff, eh? While you’re certainly a hero in my book, I don’t know what to do with the rest of it.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: For now, the best we can do is try and keep Kyurem busy. Battle it with everything you’ve got, and I’m sure you’ll succeed!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_snivy_00
TEXT: Now that was an inspiring battle! Just goes to show that when people and Pokémon work together, we can overcome any differences and achieve our biggest dreams!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_snivy_01
TEXT: Snivy looks like it learned a lot from you, too. In fact, I think it’s ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_snivy_02
TEXT: And while this probably won’t be the last we see of Kyurem, you averted a real disaster by defeating it. For now, enjoy your adventures, %PLAYERNAME%!

TEXT: Fascinating, isn’t it? But if we’ve learned anything from this, it’s that there’s a balance to this, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_1
TEXT: Duality, balance, strength, ideals... I should’ve been a philosopher! So much to noodle over!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_2
TEXT: That said, I think I’ve managed to come up with a theory that makes sense of it all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_3
TEXT: But if I’ve learned anything from all this, it’s the value of working together—so I’m going to run it by my fellow researchers before I share it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_4
TEXT: Keep your eyes peeled for anything of note, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re close to wrapping this one up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_1
TEXT: Ah, great timing! The data our friends helped us gather led me to detect and pinpoint a potent freezing energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_2
TEXT: And the source? None other than Kyurem, a Legendary Pokémon whose frozen body produces ultracold air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_3
TEXT: Intriguingly, Kyurem is closely associated with two other Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom. Each of them seems to have distinct perspectives: one focused on truth, the other on ideals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_4
TEXT: It reminds me of the strange phenomena we’ve been seeing lately. These Legendary Pokémon must be connected to it all somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_9_dialogue_5
TEXT: You’d better be ready though, %PLAYERNAME%. Kyurem is no pushover, and I have a feeling you’ll be facing it before long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_2
TEXT: The cause of this phenomenon must be something we haven’t encountered before. However, I don’t recall agreeing to share the rest of my report with you, darling.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: Isn’t it nice having friends you can count on, %PLAYERNAME%? You know the feeling well, don’t you, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: Speaking of which, I saw Candela checking on other Trainers and their Pokémon earlier. Her fire comes from understanding that working together makes us stronger than we are on our own!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can’t say the same for Arlo, though. He zipped off on his own, and I hear even the other Team GO Rocket folks don’t know what he’s up to.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: Those two seem like complete opposites, but I’m guessing we’ll learn more soon enough. Which leader would you like to follow this go-around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Can’t you see I’m busy? These interruptions are an immense waste of my time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_2
TEXT: All these Grunts keep fumbling my perfect plans because they can’t follow the simplest instructions. The last thing I need is you tugging at my hem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_3
TEXT: Someone like you could never understand what I’m trying to do here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_4
TEXT: This is your first and final warning: I won’t tolerate your meddling. Leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_1
TEXT: My friends are my fire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_2
TEXT: You, Professor Willow, Rhi—and especially Spark and Blanche—all know how to bring out the best in me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_3
TEXT: Not to mention my trusty Pokémon! Ponyta has always fueled my passion to train and improve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_4
TEXT: And all this weird weather has me thinking... I’m not scared of the heat—I won’t let anything happen to the people and Pokémon I care about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_5
TEXT: We’re stronger together. If we focus on that, we can take whatever comes next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Tch. I can finally wrap up this nonsense. Did you enjoy wasting your time with those Grunts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_2
TEXT: Hmph. Perhaps there’s merit in having some minions keep the worst distractions at bay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_3
TEXT: See if you can wrap your head around this. Do you know the Pokémon Parasect?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_4
TEXT: It looks like a bug, but the mushroom growing on its back does all the thinking. Those Grunts are the bug. I am the mushroom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_5
TEXT: Perhaps having a few bugs around is acceptable, as long as everyone remembers who the mushroom is.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_1
TEXT: So I noticed something while we were researching. A lot of wild Pokémon do stuff that’s mutually beneficial...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_2
TEXT: But give-and-take doesn’t mean they only rely on others. Many can—and do—thrive on their own, as independent creatures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_3
TEXT: Like using one candle to light another. That doesn’t make the first one burn any less bright.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_4
TEXT: I can’t guess what’s coming next, but I gotta trust that my friends have the strength to make it out OK, whether they’re on their own or at my side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_5
TEXT: And that includes you, %PLAYERNAME%! I know you’ve gone up against stuff I can’t even imagine...but I wanna be there to help—if and when you need me.
