RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_00
TEXT: Greetings. Lapras and I were just finishing our latest analysis.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_01
TEXT: A well-balanced approach has proven productive not only in battle, but in other areas as well.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_team_02
TEXT: We have you to thank, %PLAYERNAME%. Your assistance has allowed us to achieve another breakthrough.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_00
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%. You should know that Cliff has declared his intention to become “the most balanced Trainer ever.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_01
TEXT: I can’t say I’m enthused about an enemy improving his skills, but at least you kept him in check when his reckless training methods could have caused trouble.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_02
TEXT: I genuinely appreciate your support in that matter.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_00
TEXT: Yo, %PLAYERNAME%! I just wrapped up an intense solo mission.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_01
TEXT: I’m still warming up to going solo, but I learn a lot from it, too. Plus, it makes me appreciate being with my team even more.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_02
TEXT: Thanks for everything. Here’s to always being ready to help each other out, whether we’re together or apart!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_00
TEXT: Hey, what’d you say to Arlo earlier? I’ve been hearing he’s working closely with the Grunts—like, cooperatively! That doesn’t sound like him at all.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_01
TEXT: It’s a shame they’re probably getting up to no good. Team GO Rocket are the champs of misplaced passion, huh?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_02
TEXT: Anyhow, thanks for handling him. Whatever they try to pull in the future, we’ll stop them together!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_00
TEXT: Heya, %PLAYERNAME%! You keeping frosty?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_01
TEXT: Wild to think how this all kicked off with a beach retreat, huh? I guess things are always going a little haywire around you though, so I can’t say I’m surprised!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_02
TEXT: You’re totally invited to my next hang. Anyways, thanks for always being down for an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_00
TEXT: Hey, thanks for keeping an eye on Sierra earlier, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_01
TEXT: She usually gives everybody a real cold shoulder, so I’m kinda surprised she went easy on you! ...A little easy.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_02
TEXT: She’s still super mean, and, y’know, evil, but hey—we’ll know just how to stop her next time she stirs up trouble!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: We’ve found it at last! Kyurem, the Boundary Pokémon, is almost definitely the cause of the ongoing anomalies we’ve been observing.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: This Legendary Pokémon is missing parts from its body. That may be why it has to stabilize by freezing itself!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Its genes are similar to two other Legendary Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom—and my readings indicate it’s seeking them out as we speak.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: Let’s keep our eyes on the situation, %PLAYERNAME%. Things could spiral out of control if these powerful Pokémon meet.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: So, Kyurem is able to fuse with either the Vast White Pokémon, Reshiram, or the Deep Black Pokémon, Zekrom.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: In doing so, it absorbs the other Pokémon to become White Kyurem or Black Kyurem, respectively.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: That said, we don’t know which of the two Kyurem will go for, and we can only focus on one at a time.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which means that whether we track down Reshiram or Zekrom first, we’re giving Kyurem a chance to find the other.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_04
TEXT: So, would you rather deal with Reshiram and Black Kyurem, or Zekrom and White Kyurem?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_00
TEXT: I’ve heard that Reshiram can shift the atmosphere with heat energy by flaring its tail. And according to myth, when the people of the past became consumed with greed, Reshiram would burn down their kingdoms.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_01
TEXT: Intense stuff. And supposedly, it wants to help anyone wishing to build a world of truth.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_02
TEXT: What would you say your “truth” is, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_03
TEXT: Might be a good idea to get your answer straight before you seek out Reshiram. Don’t get scorched!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_00
TEXT: Zekrom’s tail contains a giant electrical generator. When the interior part of the tail spins like a motor, it creates lightning it can use to blast its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_01
TEXT: And in the past, when people lost sight of the righteousness in their hearts, Zekrom would raze their kingdoms with bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_02
TEXT: Intense stuff. And supposedly, Zekrom also assists those who wish to build an ideal world. What does your ideal world look like, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_03
TEXT: Mine has a comprehensive Pokémon database that lists their habitats and distribution across the world! Get yourself a dream like that, and Zekrom won’t have to zap you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Supposedly, Reshiram and Zekrom were once a single Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: They say that it split apart during some kind of conflict in ancient times.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: I haven’t turned up much on Kyurem’s origins, though—just hearsay from other researchers.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: I do love a good mystery! Anyhow, all three of these powerful Pokémon seem to have a deep connection with Unova.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_04
TEXT: Perhaps we can get a better understanding of them by studying other Pokémon first discovered in the region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Oshawott as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_01
TEXT: Oshawott fights by using the scalchop on its stomach like a knife, blocking attacks and then quickly retaliating.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_02
TEXT: They keep honing their skills as they evolve. They seem like a dedicated bunch!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Oshawott and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Snivy as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_01
TEXT: You see its short arms? It’s quite good at using its vines to compensate!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_02
TEXT: They’re known to be intelligent and calm, but they become plenty swift when they’re charged up with sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Snivy and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_00
TEXT: Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Tepig as their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_01
TEXT: Just don’t underestimate how quick they are! If you don’t watch your lunch carefully, Tepig will be eating it before you can blink!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_02
TEXT: The ravenous little glutton also has a great sense of smell that helps it find food in the wild, which it then crisps up to eat, lickety-split!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_03
TEXT: There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Tepig and see what it has to teach you!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_00
TEXT: Good news—we’ve found Reshiram! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Zekrom. Are you ready for what’s next?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_01
TEXT: Once Zekrom and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into Black Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_02
TEXT: From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as Black Kyurem, it would battle to protect an ideal world that will exist in the future for people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_03
TEXT: A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_00
TEXT: Good news—we’ve found Zekrom! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Reshiram. Are you ready for what’s next?

TEXT: Once Reshiram and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into White Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_02
TEXT: From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as White Kyurem, it would strive to protect the world of truth it has foreseen for people and Pokémon alike.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_03
TEXT: A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_00
TEXT: This is incredible... I’ve read about Absofusion, but I never dared to dream I’d witness it firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_01
TEXT: What about you? Did you ever think you'd see something so amazing?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_02
TEXT: People are so passionate about their dreams. I used to wonder if our differences were irreconcilable, but this has shown me that we all complement each other when we’re united.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_03
TEXT: I don’t know if I’ll be around long enough to see the future Kyurem awaits, but I’m excited to work with you to make it a reality!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_00
TEXT: Good, you’re here! I have news about Kyurem, the Dragon- and Ice-type Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: Supposedly, it uses its powers over ice to freeze its body to stabilize its cellular structure.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Just thinking about that sends a chill down my spine!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_03
TEXT: And on that note, let’s do some warm-ups. Gotta stay limber for a big day of exploring, right?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: Rumor has it that Kyurem dwells in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: Unova is an extraordinary place! It has bustling modern metropolises, but there are also tranquil forests whose inhabitants live in harmony with nature.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: And since we’re going to unravel a Unova mystery, it’s only fitting that we get help from Pokémon first discovered there.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: Which of these first partner Pokémon would you like to join you on this adventure?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_00
TEXT: Here’s a fun fact about Oshawott: the shell it has is called a “scalchop.”

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_01
TEXT: They use their scalchop not only as a blade in battle, but also as a tool to break open hard Berries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_02
TEXT: They’ll even sharpen them on riverbed stones, something apparently learned by mimicking humans using whetstones.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_03
TEXT: In other words, Oshawott need to take good care of their scalchops in order to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_04
TEXT: I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_00
TEXT: Snivy prefers to avoid groups, so it’s a great match for Trainers who tend to be more independent.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_01
TEXT: The leaf on its tail generates energy when exposed to sunlight. When it’s not feeling well, the tail will start to droop.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_02
TEXT: On the other hand—or vine—Snivy that get enough light become swift and dexterous!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_03
TEXT: In other words, Snivy need alone time and ample sunlight to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_04
TEXT: I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_00
TEXT: Make sure you have lots of Berries on hand if you’re going adventuring with Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_01
TEXT: They use their excellent sense of smell to find food, and then they cook it up nice and crispy before they eat it!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_02
TEXT: It can launch fireballs from its nose, but don’t expect more than pitch-black smoke if it gets sick.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_03
TEXT: In any case, Tepig need snacks aplenty to thrive.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_04
TEXT: I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. So, given what I can glean from my research, Kyurem seems to be looking for something.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: From what I’ve read, it’s waiting for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with either truth or ideals.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_01
TEXT: Encountering gigantic Pokémon, unfurling incredible mysteries, foiling Team GO Rocket countless times... We’ve faced extraordinary challenges together, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_02
TEXT: Our research has introduced us to Pokémon from all over the world, forged wonderful friendships, and led to some amazing discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_04

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_00
TEXT: Good news, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve made a breakthrough on those acoustic mysteries I was looking into.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_01
TEXT: And as I suspected, they’re not just any sound wave, they’re the unique melodies of the Mythical Pokémon Meloetta!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_02
TEXT: Meloetta uses song to influence the emotions of those who hear it. And on that note, I’d like you to try and spot any unusual behavior in the local Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03
TEXT: It’s not every day we get to study a Mythical Pokémon, so let’s make the most of this opportunity!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_00

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_03

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_00
TEXT: If it isn’t our intrepid enter-Trainer! Say, did you know that Meloetta’s melodies have inspired many famous songs?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_01
TEXT: It’s just fascinating—Meloetta shows us how music helps us to forge special bonds with one another.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_02
TEXT: It’s not unlike your amazing ability to connect with other people and Pokémon. Every new Pokémon you catch or Trainer you meet is a new potential friend!

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03
TEXT: And on that uplifting note, get out there and see what new friendships await, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_00
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve dug up some useful information on Meloetta. Did you know that it was first discovered in the Unova region?

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01
TEXT: That might not seem critical, but we have to take advantage of every scrap of information we can to help us make sense of Meloetta’s behavior.

RESOURCE ID: go_tour_2025_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_02

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_3
TEXT: Both Blanche and Cliff sought innovation in battling, yet one took a defensive stance, and the other turned to the pursuit of power alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_5_dialogue_4
TEXT: I would like to examine this further. If you will excuse me, I must review these findings with Professor Willow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_1
TEXT: You are more experienced than I with battles, %PLAYERNAME%, so please provide your insight. Would you agree that a balanced approach is important for a Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_2
TEXT: Intriguing. Perhaps that is the key, then, to understanding these recent events.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_3
TEXT: All things have two sides. Focusing on only one of those sides is unlikely to yield good results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_4
TEXT: Let us look to the future. Experience suggests we may soon receive word from the professor regarding Candela or the last Team GO Rocket leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_6_dialogue_5
TEXT: Let us ready ourselves. In the meantime, I will—I think I have this expression right—“catch ya later.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_1
TEXT: Perfect—now we have a clear picture of what Candela and Arlo were up to.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_2
TEXT: Candela was focused on cooperation, whereas Arlo went in the opposite direction. In the end, they both learned a bit about balance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_3
TEXT: Some people make the best of the strengths and relationships that they have. Others focus on shaping the world to their own ideals.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_7_dialogue_4
TEXT: Fascinating, isn’t it? But if we’ve learned anything from this, it’s that there’s a balance to this, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_1
TEXT: Duality, balance, strength, ideals... I should’ve been a philosopher! So much to noodle over!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_2
TEXT: That said, I think I’ve managed to come up with a theory that makes sense of it all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_3
TEXT: But if I’ve learned anything from all this, it’s the value of working together—so I’m going to run it by my fellow researchers before I share it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_8_dialogue_4
TEXT: Keep your eyes peeled for anything of note, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re close to wrapping this one up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_dectr_3_sierra_dialogue_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_1
TEXT: Isn’t it nice having friends you can count on, %PLAYERNAME%? You know the feeling well, don’t you, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_2
TEXT: Speaking of which, I saw Candela checking on other Trainers and their Pokémon earlier. Her fire comes from understanding that working together makes us stronger than we are on our own!

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_3
TEXT: Can’t say the same for Arlo, though. He zipped off on his own, and I hear even the other Team GO Rocket folks don’t know what he’s up to.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_1_dialogue_4
TEXT: Those two seem like complete opposites, but I’m guessing we’ll learn more soon enough. Which leader would you like to follow this go-around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Can’t you see I’m busy? These interruptions are an immense waste of my time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_arlo_dialogue_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_2_candela_dialogue_5
TEXT: We’re stronger together. If we focus on that, we can take whatever comes next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_1
TEXT: Tch. I can finally wrap up this nonsense. Did you enjoy wasting your time with those Grunts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_2
TEXT: Hmph. Perhaps there’s merit in having some minions keep the worst distractions at bay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_3
TEXT: See if you can wrap your head around this. Do you know the Pokémon Parasect?

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_4
TEXT: It looks like a bug, but the mushroom growing on its back does all the thinking. Those Grunts are the bug. I am the mushroom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_arlo_dialogue_5
TEXT: Perhaps having a few bugs around is acceptable, as long as everyone remembers who the mushroom is.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_1
TEXT: So I noticed something while we were researching. A lot of wild Pokémon do stuff that’s mutually beneficial...

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_2
TEXT: But give-and-take doesn’t mean they only rely on others. Many can—and do—thrive on their own, as independent creatures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_3
TEXT: Like using one candle to light another. That doesn’t make the first one burn any less bright.

RESOURCE ID: quest_title_season_17_febtr_3_candela_dialogue_4
