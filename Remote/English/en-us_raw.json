"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_1", "Go ahead and take a deep breath in! Smell that sweet scent wafting in the air?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_2", "There’s no deceiving a Pokémon Professor’s nose! That lovely aroma’s all the proof we need that the Grass-type Bounsweet must be nearby. And in great numbers, by the scent of it!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_3", "Now go on, follow your nose! Try and bring a Bounsweet back so we can study it!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_0", "I’d recognize that smell of success a mile away, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve happened on a bounty of Bounsweet!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_1", "Here’s a fact: we’re not the only ones interested in Bounsweet. Bird Pokémon are always after them, too!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_2", "One fact isn’t enough for you? Well, did you know that Bounsweet secrete a sweet—and delicious—sweat? Now you do! I sure wish I smelled that good!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_3", "Ahem. In any event, why don’t you head out and catch some more so we can keep our sweet new friends safe?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_1", "Now that we’re acquainted with the delightful Bounsweet, let’s familiarize ourselves with its Evolution, Steenee.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_2", "Keep a sharp eye out for a Steenee performing its signature twirl. When they spin like that, they’re spreading their amazing scent far and wide.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_3", "Just a whiff will give you a surge of happiness, in fact. So what are you waiting for, %PLAYERNAME%? We’ve got joy to...well, enjoy!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_0", "Wow! What an impressive Tsareena!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_1", "But make sure you keep your guard up!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_2", "Tsareena’s kick can hit hard enough to take out even the toughest kickboxing champ.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_3", "Anyhow, thanks for all the assists today, %PLAYERNAME%. Stay sharp and keep well out of kicking distance!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, hi! It’s pretty hot out here, don’t you think? The heat must be coming from all the Cyndaquil running about!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_1", "Are you familiar with it? It’s a Fire-type Pokémon known for its timid nature.",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_2", "Since they scare easily, they’re usually found curled up in a little ball—and they’ll flare the flames on their backs to protect themselves when attacked!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_3", "Why don’t you grab a pocket fan to stay cool and try to catch one of these fascinating Pokémon?",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_0", "That’s quite a Cyndaquil you’ve befriended, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re on fire—er, not literally, thankfully.",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_1", "Let me reward you with some fun tidbits! Did you know that a Cyndaquil’s flames burn hottest when they’re startled?",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_2", "And its Evolution, Quilava, will turn its back on opponents just to show off how ferociously its fire blazes!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_3", "Let’s evolve your Cyndaquil into a Quilava. While I’m not jumping at the idea of making it even hotter around here, I AM eager to study the variance in flame intensity as they evolve.",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_0", "Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! Now, let’s take a closer look at your Quilava. You’re on a hot streak!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_1", "As I mentioned, Quilava tend to use the heat of their flames to intimidate foes. Those flames burn even stronger when it prepares to fight!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_2", "Your Quilava seems like a real firebrand! I bet it’ll be even more of a force to be reckoned with once it evolves.",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_3", "On that note, let’s turn the thermostat up to max—evolve your Quilava into Typhlosion! There’s learning to be had!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_0", "Oh! I was wondering why I was feeling so toasty, but now I see—you’re back with Typhlosion! Let’s take a moment to marvel at its raw power.",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_1", "When a Typhlosion’s rage peaks, it gets so hot that it’ll send anything that touches it up in flames!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_2", "I’m pretty sure my eyebrows are getting singed, but it’s totally worth it for an up-close encounter with such an awe-inspiring Pokémon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_3", "You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next adventure—stay cool!",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_0", "Oh! Hi, %PLAYERNAME%! Don’t mind the mess...",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_1", "I was just enjoying the shade and jotting down a few notes when I noticed some slime on my coat.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_2", "Research opportunities come in unexpected forms, and I have an inkling this residue belongs to a certain clingy culprit.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_3", "While I figure out how to clean this up, could you look around and let me know if you observe anything interesting in the area?",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_0", "Aha! I knew it! This goo came from Goomy, the Soft Tissue Pokémon.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_1", "Goomy tend to live in damp, shady places so their bodies don’t dry out. I should’ve watched where I was sitting!",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_2", "I’d love to learn more about Goomy and its Evolutions while we have this opportunity.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_3", "Given that you seem better than me at staying slime-free, would you mind evolving Goomy into Sliggoo?",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_0", "You’re a slime savant, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_1", "But take extra care around your new Sliggoo. Its mucus can dissolve pretty much anything.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_2", "Also, I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s worth mentioning that Sliggoo are known to have trouble drawing a line between friends and food.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_3", "Might be worth seeing if yours is ready to evolve. It could save you the trouble of fending off a well-intentioned but melty hug!",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_0", "Simply slime-tastic, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_1", "Goodra is an amazingly friendly Pokémon with a penchant for hugging its Trainer. And yes, before you ask—that can make things pretty gooey.",
"quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_2", "This Pokémon isn’t all slime and rainbows though. The strikes from Goodra’s horns land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.",
