"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_01", "I can’t say I’m enthused about an enemy improving his skills, but at least you kept him in check when his reckless training methods could have caused trouble.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_blanche_tgr_02", "I genuinely appreciate your support in that matter.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_00", "Yo, %PLAYERNAME%! I just wrapped up an intense solo mission.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_01", "I’m still warming up to going solo, but I learn a lot from it, too. Plus, it makes me appreciate being with my team even more.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_team_02", "Thanks for everything. Here’s to always being ready to help each other out, whether we’re together or apart!",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_00", "Hey, what’d you say to Arlo earlier? I’ve been hearing he’s working closely with the Grunts—like, cooperatively! That doesn’t sound like him at all.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_01", "It’s a shame they’re probably getting up to no good. Team GO Rocket are the champs of misplaced passion, huh?",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_candela_tgr_02", "Anyhow, thanks for handling him. Whatever they try to pull in the future, we’ll stop them together!",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_00", "Heya, %PLAYERNAME%! You keeping frosty?",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_01", "Wild to think how this all kicked off with a beach retreat, huh? I guess things are always going a little haywire around you though, so I can’t say I’m surprised!",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_team_02", "You’re totally invited to my next hang. Anyways, thanks for always being down for an adventure!",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_00", "Hey, thanks for keeping an eye on Sierra earlier, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_01", "She usually gives everybody a real cold shoulder, so I’m kinda surprised she went easy on you! ...A little easy.",
"go_tour_2025_global_seasonal_rewards_tr_spark_tgr_02", "She’s still super mean, and, y’know, evil, but hey—we’ll know just how to stop her next time she stirs up trouble!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_00", "We’ve found it at last! Kyurem, the Boundary Pokémon, is almost definitely the cause of the ongoing anomalies we’ve been observing.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_01", "This Legendary Pokémon is missing parts from its body. That may be why it has to stabilize by freezing itself!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_02", "Its genes are similar to two other Legendary Pokémon, Reshiram and Zekrom—and my readings indicate it’s seeking them out as we speak.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_00_03", "Let’s keep our eyes on the situation, %PLAYERNAME%. Things could spiral out of control if these powerful Pokémon meet.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_00", "So, Kyurem is able to fuse with either the Vast White Pokémon, Reshiram, or the Deep Black Pokémon, Zekrom.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_01", "In doing so, it absorbs the other Pokémon to become White Kyurem or Black Kyurem, respectively.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_02", "That said, we don’t know which of the two Kyurem will go for, and we can only focus on one at a time.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_03", "Which means that whether we track down Reshiram or Zekrom first, we’re giving Kyurem a chance to find the other.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_01_04", "So, would you rather deal with Reshiram and Black Kyurem, or Zekrom and White Kyurem?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_00", "I’ve heard that Reshiram can shift the atmosphere with heat energy by flaring its tail. And according to myth, when the people of the past became consumed with greed, Reshiram would burn down their kingdoms.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_01", "Intense stuff. And supposedly, it wants to help anyone wishing to build a world of truth.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_02", "What would you say your “truth” is, %PLAYERNAME%?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_black_03", "Might be a good idea to get your answer straight before you seek out Reshiram. Don’t get scorched!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_00", "Zekrom’s tail contains a giant electrical generator. When the interior part of the tail spins like a motor, it creates lightning it can use to blast its surroundings.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_01", "And in the past, when people lost sight of the righteousness in their hearts, Zekrom would raze their kingdoms with bolts of lightning.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_02", "Intense stuff. And supposedly, Zekrom also assists those who wish to build an ideal world. What does your ideal world look like, %PLAYERNAME%?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_02_white_03", "Mine has a comprehensive Pokémon database that lists their habitats and distribution across the world! Get yourself a dream like that, and Zekrom won’t have to zap you!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_00", "Supposedly, Reshiram and Zekrom were once a single Pokémon.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_01", "They say that it split apart during some kind of conflict in ancient times.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_02", "I haven’t turned up much on Kyurem’s origins, though—just hearsay from other researchers.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_03", "I do love a good mystery! Anyhow, all three of these powerful Pokémon seem to have a deep connection with Unova.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_03_04", "Perhaps we can get a better understanding of them by studying other Pokémon first discovered in the region.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00", "Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Oshawott as their first partner Pokémon.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_01", "Oshawott fights by using the scalchop on its stomach like a knife, blocking attacks and then quickly retaliating.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_02", "They keep honing their skills as they evolve. They seem like a dedicated bunch!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_03", "There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Oshawott and see what it has to teach you!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_00", "Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Snivy as their first partner Pokémon.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_01", "You see its short arms? It’s quite good at using its vines to compensate!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_02", "They’re known to be intelligent and calm, but they become plenty swift when they’re charged up with sunlight.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_snivy_03", "There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Snivy and see what it has to teach you!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_00", "Lots of Trainers from Unova pick Tepig as their first partner Pokémon.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_01", "Just don’t underestimate how quick they are! If you don’t watch your lunch carefully, Tepig will be eating it before you can blink!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_02", "The ravenous little glutton also has a great sense of smell that helps it find food in the wild, which it then crisps up to eat, lickety-split!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_04_tepig_03", "There’s always something new we can learn from Pokémon, even if we have hundreds of battles under our belts. Take good care of Tepig and see what it has to teach you!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_00", "Good news—we’ve found Reshiram! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Zekrom. Are you ready for what’s next?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_01", "Once Zekrom and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into Black Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_02", "From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as Black Kyurem, it would battle to protect an ideal world that will exist in the future for people and Pokémon.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_black_03", "A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_00", "Good news—we’ve found Zekrom! The less good news is that Kyurem’s attention is now focused on Reshiram. Are you ready for what’s next?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_01", "Once Reshiram and Kyurem have calmed down, we can use DNA Splicers to help them fuse into White Kyurem. But don't you worry about those technical matters!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_02", "From what I understand, Kyurem yearns to be whole, and as White Kyurem, it would strive to protect the world of truth it has foreseen for people and Pokémon alike.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_05_white_03", "A Pokémon with such dedication deserves a chance to fight for that future. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_00", "This is incredible... I’ve read about Absofusion, but I never dared to dream I’d witness it firsthand!",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_01", "What about you? Did you ever think you'd see something so amazing?",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_02", "People are so passionate about their dreams. I used to wonder if our differences were irreconcilable, but this has shown me that we all complement each other when we’re united.",
"go_tour_2025_global_sr_dialog_06_03", "I don’t know if I’ll be around long enough to see the future Kyurem awaits, but I’m excited to work with you to make it a reality!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_00", "Good, you’re here! I have news about Kyurem, the Dragon- and Ice-type Legendary Pokémon!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_01", "Supposedly, it uses its powers over ice to freeze its body to stabilize its cellular structure.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_02", "Just thinking about that sends a chill down my spine!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_00_03", "And on that note, let’s do some warm-ups. Gotta stay limber for a big day of exploring, right?",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_00", "Rumor has it that Kyurem dwells in the Unova region.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_01", "Unova is an extraordinary place! It has bustling modern metropolises, but there are also tranquil forests whose inhabitants live in harmony with nature.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_02", "And since we’re going to unravel a Unova mystery, it’s only fitting that we get help from Pokémon first discovered there.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_01_03", "Which of these first partner Pokémon would you like to join you on this adventure?",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_00", "Here’s a fun fact about Oshawott: the shell it has is called a “scalchop.”",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_01", "They use their scalchop not only as a blade in battle, but also as a tool to break open hard Berries.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_02", "They’ll even sharpen them on riverbed stones, something apparently learned by mimicking humans using whetstones.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_03", "In other words, Oshawott need to take good care of their scalchops in order to thrive.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_oshawott_04", "I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_00", "Snivy prefers to avoid groups, so it’s a great match for Trainers who tend to be more independent.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_01", "The leaf on its tail generates energy when exposed to sunlight. When it’s not feeling well, the tail will start to droop.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_02", "On the other hand—or vine—Snivy that get enough light become swift and dexterous!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_03", "In other words, Snivy need alone time and ample sunlight to thrive.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_snivy_04", "I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_00", "Make sure you have lots of Berries on hand if you’re going adventuring with Tepig!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_01", "They use their excellent sense of smell to find food, and then they cook it up nice and crispy before they eat it!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_02", "It can launch fireballs from its nose, but don’t expect more than pitch-black smoke if it gets sick.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_03", "In any case, Tepig need snacks aplenty to thrive.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_02_tepig_04", "I’d bet Kyurem has some particular needs of its own. While you train your new partner, I’ll study Kyurem to see what they might be.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_00", "Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. So, given what I can glean from my research, Kyurem seems to be looking for something.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_01", "From what I’ve read, it’s waiting for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with either truth or ideals.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_02", "Heady stuff, eh? While you’re certainly a hero in my book, I don’t know what to do with the rest of it.",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_03_03", "For now, the best we can do is try and keep Kyurem busy. Battle it with everything you’ve got, and I’m sure you’ll succeed!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_00", "Now that was an inspiring battle! Just goes to show that when people and Pokémon work together, we can overcome any differences and achieve our biggest dreams!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_01", "Oshawott looks like it learned a lot from you, too. In fact, I think it’s ready to evolve!",
"go_tour_2025_irl_sr_dialog_04_oshawott_02", "And while this probably won’t be the last we see of Kyurem, you averted a real disaster by defeating it. For now, enjoy your adventures, %PLAYERNAME%!",
