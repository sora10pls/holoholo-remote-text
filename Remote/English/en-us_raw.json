"go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_03_04", "So y’know, keep your eyes peeled! You just might run into a super rare Pokémon! Good luck—oh, and don’t get spooked by the shadows!",
"go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_04_00", "Oh! It’s you, %PLAYERNAME%. You caught me by surprise.",
"go_fest_2024_irl_sr_park_04_01", "Sorry for the confusion. I was on Marshadow’s trail, but it looks to me like you’ve already made its acquaintance!",
