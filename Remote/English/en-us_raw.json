"quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_blanche_dialogue_2", "My research has led me to one conclusion: obvious though it may seem, the surest way to win a battle is to never lose it.",

"quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_2", "The full-power attacks I’m working on will make Team GO Rocket unstoppable. What with that look? Don’t believe it?",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_3", "It’s easy. You get your Pokémon to hit so hard that their opponents never even get a CHANCE to hit back!",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_4", "Hmph, not that it matters for you. I doubt a weakling like you could ever get your Pokémon to pull an attack like that off.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_2_cliff_dialogue_5", "And that means if you’re hanging around here, you’re holding me back. So beat it!",

"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_2", "My analysis of recent battles has disproven my previous theory—though the fault does not lie with you.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_3", "I had Lapras so focused on defense that I neglected to give it opportunities to attack.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_4", "I fear I’ve stymied its growth. The logical next step is to provide Berries, praise, and—critically—a more well-rounded training regimen.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_blanche_dialogue_5", "Further work can wait until after we rest, though. %PLAYERNAME%, if you’ve taught me anything today, it’s the importance of a balanced approach.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_1", "Hrm. Strength reigns supreme, but something’s still missing!",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_2", "The problem with only focusing on attacks is that it makes you let your guard down.",
"quest_title_season_17_jantr_3_cliff_dialogue_3", "Maybe the boss would prefer it if I used offense AND defense...",
